## Squashtoberfest 2019

We are gearing up for Squashtoberfest 2019 and this year we want include both
Magento and Adobe repositories in the fun! In summary:

- To qualify, submit 5 or more pull requests during October 2019 to any open repositories under [github.com/adobe](github.com/adobe)
    or [github.com/magento](github.com/magento)
- At the end of the month we will crunch the numbers to see who qualified.
- We will get in touch with qualifying contributors to get their shirt sizes and
    then ship them cool swag!

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Where Can I Find Good Issues To Tackle?

For Magento repositories, the [Community
Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/magento/projects/6) is a great place to look
for issues needing confirmation (Ready for QA column), issues ready for development
(Ready for Dev column) or good first issues.

For Adobe repositories, doing a [GitHub search for Good First Issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=org%3Aadobe+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22&s=updated&type=Issues)
is a good place to look.

#### What Is The Best Way To Get Involved?

Once you've identified an issue you think you can help out with, comment on the
issue and mention you'd like to tackle it. Work with the project maintainers to
get the issue assigned to you.

#### How Do I Send A Pull Request?

Each project is different. Your best bet is to read each project's contribution
guidelines - these are usually documented in the project repo as
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or sometimes it exists under `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`). Many
projects also have a pull request template enabled, so when you open a pull
request, you'll be presented with a checklist of things to prepare.

#### Is This Event Related To Hacktoberfest?

We are doing essentially the same thing, in the same time frame, in a spirit of
solidarity and collaboration, but we are not officially related to
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
